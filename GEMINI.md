# Project Overview

This project is a collection of Python notebooks and scripts designed for learning the Python programming language. The files cover fundamental concepts such as variables, strings, lists, dictionaries, conditional statements (`if`), and loops (`while`). The instructional comments in the notebooks are in Korean.

# Running the Code

## Python Scripts (`.py`)

These files can be executed directly from the terminal using the Python interpreter.

```bash
python codes/05_if.py
```

## Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb`)

These files can be opened and run in a Jupyter Notebook environment. You will need to have Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab installed.

1.  **Install Jupyter:**
    ```bash
    pip install notebook
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    pip install jupyterlab
    ```

2.  **Run Jupyter:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    jupyter lab
    ```

3.  **Open Notebooks:**
    Once Jupyter is running, your web browser will open a new tab. Navigate to the `codes` directory and click on a `.ipynb` file to open it.

# Development Conventions

The file naming convention indicates the topic covered in each file (e.g., `01_variables_string.ipynb`, `05_if.py`). This suggests a structured learning path, starting with the basics and progressing to more complex topics.
